            <p>
                Since october 7th, 2023, over 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, the vast majority of which are civilians, and 13,000 of which are children. Over 74,000 people have been maimed, seriously wounded, or injured by Israeli strikes on Gaza. The region is facing mass hunger, and some families aren't even able to get their hands on a few hundred calories per day. How can you help give these people relief?
            </p>
            <p>
                We are Henrico for Palestine, an awareness campaign designed to promote knowledge of what's happening in Palestine, and more importantly knowledge of all the avenues people can take to donate towards the people of Palestine. We are in support of a free Palestine, from river to sea, and encourage everyone, not just witin Henrico or just within Virginia, but throughout the country to act towards helping the people of Palestine by any means available to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main features of this sight is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="donate.html">Information on how you can donate towards helping Palestine.</a></li>
                <li><a href="how_to_help.html">Information on how you can promote these avenues, and how you can spread awareness of what is ongoing in palestine.</a></li>
                <li><a href="news_on_palestine.html">Access to other websites promoting knowledge of what is ongoing in Palestine.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Lastly, and most importantly, prevention in the future. The only way for Palestine to recover from the viscious attacks perpetrated against it is for a permanent ceasefire, and Palestinian self-determination to be recognized by the whole world, rather than denied by nations like Israel and the United States. The only way this tragedy can be avoided again is if there is a free palestine, and so, we say,
            </p>
