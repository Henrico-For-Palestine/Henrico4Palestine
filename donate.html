        <h1>Donate</h1>

        <p>This is the most direct way you can help the people in Palestine, in particular in Gaza. While we only have six organizations listed below there are many more you can donate to. It is recommended, if you intend to donate to any org, on what that org is actually doing and how they are helping. Each section's image will be a link to the website, alongside a text link to each website at the bottom of each section.</p>

        <p>All links and donations are not made to Henrico for Palestine and any and all websites provided will lead to donates directly to their respective orgs. Under no instance will Henrico for Palestine handle donations or deal with moving funds along to other organizations.</p>
